# AI-Ergasia2
This is a repository for my school assignments involving artificial intelligence.
It is mainly in greek so i don't know how usefull it's going to be for everybody.
I mainly use this repo so me and my team can work efficently on thin school project.

If you willing to look more on the code and figure what it is doing you can find a python implementation of the GSAT algorithm and the full sentence resolution property,
the end target of this school project is to create a knowledge base and after that check if a new sentence can be inserted in this knowledge base.
